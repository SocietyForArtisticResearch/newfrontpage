# RC landing page redesign

## Motivation

* make journals and institutions easier to find.
* show sara announcements on a more prominent place.
* organise information pages in a more logical way.

We have moved the content of the sidebar to the footer.
The portals and journals now have dedicated overview pages instead of being listed on the frontpage.
The user menu is stacked away under a 


## Structure

The redesigned landing page consists of 3 sections:
- header
- content 
- footer

The header and footer elements do not have a fixeddfsdfdsfsd position, they may be static.

### Header

contains
   - search
   - (advanced search) register/login
   - about & help

when logged in the navigation menu is available through a 
![profile icon]("image of profile icon"). The dropdown menu as it works on smaller screens should become the default.

### Content

Content contains four tab views:
	* Home
	* Institional Portals
	* Journals 
	* Researchers

#### Tab: home

- Recent Activities
- Recent Publications
- Sar Announcements
  display title, subject sender and - header picture (<img id="result-headerImg" ...>)
  
  
#### Tab: Institional Portals

- the non-journal portals

#### Tab: Journals

- JAR, RUUKKU, VIS & Journal for Sonic Studies

#### Researchers 

- This is a view wich showcases various users. There is an option to filter by interest (keywords)

   
### Footer

contains a list of info pages, contact info etc.. see the HTML examples.
At the very bottom, there is a single line for our hosting partner from Sweden.

## Mockup structure

Links do not work
We have patched over the default RC styling, the mockup should also work well on smaller screens.
