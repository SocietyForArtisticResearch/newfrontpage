# RC Front Page Redesign

## Motivation

* make journals and institutions more prominent, easier to find
* show sara announcements
* organise other content links etc.. as footer lists

We have moved the content of the sidebar to the footer.
The portals and journals now have dedicated overview pages instead of being listed on the frontpage.


## Structure

The website consists of 3 sections:
- HEADER
- CONTENT 
- FOOTER

The header and footer elements do not have a fixed position, they may be static.

### HEADER

contains
   - search
   - (advanced search) register/login
   - about & help

### CONTENT

Content contains four tab views:
	* Home
	* Institional Portals
	* Journals 
	* Researchers

#### Tab: home

- Recent Activities
- Recent Publications
- Sar Announcements
  display title, subject sender and - header picture (<img id="result-headerImg" ...>)
  
  
#### Tab: Institional Portals

- the non-journal portals

#### Tab: Journals

- JAR, RUUKKU, VIS & Journal for Sonic Studies

#### Researchers 

- This is a view wich showcases various users. There is an option to filter by interest (keywords)

   
### FOOTER

contains a list of info pages, contact info etc.. see the HTML examples.
At the very bottom, there is a single line for our hosting partner from Sweden.

## Mockup structure

Links do not work
We have patched over the default RC styling, the mockup should also work well on smaller screens.
